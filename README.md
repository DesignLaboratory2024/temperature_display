# Temperature Display Project
The main goal of this project is to fetch temperature data and display it on the e-paper screen in the form of a temperature chart. The chart will update, providing a visual representation of temperature fluctuations.

#Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 3
* A Waveshare 7.5-inch e-paper display, used for the temperature chart.
* Waveshare E-Paper HAT, connecting the display to the Raspberry Pi.

#Software
* Python 3.x
* Necessary Python libraries for interacting with the Waveshare e-paper display
